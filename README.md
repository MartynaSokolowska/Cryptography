# Cryptography Notebooks

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks focusing on various cryptographic topics. Each notebook provides explanations, implementations, and examples related to cryptographic algorithms and concepts.

## Notebooks Overview

### SHA Cryptographic Hash Function

- Explore the SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) family, including SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512.
- Learn about their properties, usage, and practical examples of hashing data.

### Symmetric Key Encryption

- Demonstrate symmetric key encryption algorithms such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).
- Includes encryption and decryption processes, key generation, and examples of data encryption using symmetric ciphers.

### RSA Encryption

- Explanation of the RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) algorithm for public-key encryption and decryption.
- Covers key generation, encryption, decryption, and practical applications in secure communication.

### Baby Kyber Cryptography

- Introduction to the Baby Kyber cryptographic system, a simplified version of the Kyber post-quantum cryptographic scheme.
- Includes key components, encryption, decryption, and comparison with other cryptographic systems.

### Galois Field Cryptography

- Explore cryptography in Galois Fields, specifically GF(2^m).
- Covers basics of Galois Fields, operations (addition, multiplication), and their applications in error correction and cryptographic algorithms.
